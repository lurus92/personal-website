## What it does

ExamBot creates multi-format exams (quizzes, open questions, programming prompts) and provides immediate grading with structured rubrics.

## Why it exists

Educators waste time writing and reviewing assessments. ExamBot compresses that workflow while keeping humans in control.

## Luigi's role

Product discovery, UX flows, prompt engineering, RAG with course material, and deployment to Vercel.
