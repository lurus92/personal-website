## What it does

Inquiro listens to events, inspects payloads, and flags deviations from the tracking plan. It produces human-readable diffs and suggested fixes.

## Why it exists

Analytics debt compounds silently. Inquiro surfaces issues before they break dashboards or experiments.

## Luigi's role

Product definition, QA automation design, and delivery of the dashboard and alerting flows.
