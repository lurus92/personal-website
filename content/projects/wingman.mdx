## What it does

Wingman ingests transcripts, PDFs, and dashboards to produce concise briefs. It keeps source citations so teams can trust the output.

## Why it exists

Teams spend more time synthesizing than deciding. Wingman reduces context-building time so product managers and analysts can move faster.

## Luigi's role

Full build: ingestion pipeline, retrieval strategy, UI, and evaluation harness to keep hallucinations low.
