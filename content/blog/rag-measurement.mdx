summary: "How retrieval-augmented generation can compress implementation docs into a reliable QA assistant."

## The pain

Implementation docs live in wikis, sheets, and scattered tickets. When an event fails QA, teams lose hours reconciling the truth.

## The approach

1. Ingest tracking plans, data layer specs, and dashboards into a vector store.
2. Use OpenAI functions to inspect payloads and compare against the documented contract.
3. Return a concise assessment: expected parameters, missing fields, and links to owners.

## Where it shines

- During GA4 or Adobe migrations when teams juggle multiple schemas.
- For agencies that need to ship QA at pace without drowning in spreadsheets.
- As a safety net before deploying experiments to production.
