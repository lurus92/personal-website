summary: "How to move to server-side tagging while keeping A/B testing, consent, and performance healthy."
---

Server-side tagging reduces client bloat, but it introduces new risks for experimentation and consent. To keep experiments trustworthy:

- Mirror your client-side experiment IDs into the server payload so results stay aligned.
- Keep consent state authoritative on the client; pass it downstream explicitly.
- Implement payload validation so events failing schema checks are surfaced, not silently dropped.

The payoff: faster pages, higher data quality, and experiments that still ship on time.
