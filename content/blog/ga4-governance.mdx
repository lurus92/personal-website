When GA4 projects scale across brands and markets, the biggest risk is entropy. Different squads tweak events, naming slips, and soon dashboards drift. This checklist keeps implementations clean:

1. **Name everything with intent.** Adopt a measurement taxonomy that ties events to business outcomes, not just UI clicks.
2. **Lock down tag managers.** Use approvals and environments in GTM/Tealium; document who owns each container.
3. **Automate validation.** Lint your data layer, run nightly payload checks, and alert on contract breaks.
4. **Version and test.** Ship changes behind QA/preview, then promote to production with release notes.

A modest investment in governance saves months of cleanup and stakeholder trust.
