Analytics work is messy: ambiguous questions, missing context, and constant back-and-forth with stakeholders. Generic LLM chatbots rarely solve this. Instead, build narrow assistants that:

- Anchor on your tracking plan and taxonomy to avoid hallucinated metrics.
- Integrate with your BI or CDP APIs to run real queries.
- Respect governance: log actions, request confirmation, and keep humans in control.

When assistants are grounded in data contracts and observability, they become co-pilots instead of novelty demos.
