## Start with ownership

A CDP is not a database; it is a governance tool. Assign clear ownership for identities, consent, and activation use cases.

## Implementation pillars

- **Source hygiene:** instrument events and traits with the same rigor as analytics.
- **Identity strategy:** define merge rules, time-to-live, and what counts as a primary key.
- **Activation guardrails:** document which destinations are allowed and how data is tested before release.

## Tooling mix I recommend

I often pair Tealium or Segment with lightweight QA bots and dashboards in Power BI. The goal is confidence, not complexity.
