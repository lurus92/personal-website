## Why foundations matter

The fastest way to slow a growth team is to ship dashboards on top of fragile tracking. I start every engagement with a measurement contract: events, parameters, and KPIs with owners and definitions.

## Components I standardize

- **Server-side tagging** to protect page performance and enable data controls.
- **Namespace discipline** for events and parameters so analysts can query with confidence.
- **Consent-aware tagging** that avoids dark patterns and keeps legal teams aligned.

## Rollout checklist

1. Audit existing tags and dependencies.
2. Document the desired GA4 schema with examples.
3. Set up GTM or Tealium with environments and governance.
4. Pair with engineers to ship instrumentation as code.
5. Monitor with automated QA and alerting.
